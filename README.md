# GifsOnTumblr

Tumblr started (badly) converting GIFs to WebP on their dashboard, fucking up glitch art and making saving of GIFs even harder. Screw that.

This extension tweaks the dashboard to serve GIFs instead of WebP. Unfortunately your browser might download both but it's been written very quickly and out of spite.

- Chrome https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gifsontumblr/ojdchdecabcmdgloljejooedjpgaajbe
**30/08/2019 - the Chrome extension was taken down because it was deemed "suspicious" by Google because I forgot to make an icon for it, please use the new link above**
