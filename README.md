Tumblr started (badly) converting GIFs to WebP on their dashboard, fucking up glitch art and making saving of GIFs even harder. Screw that.

This extension tweaks the dashboard to serve GIFs instead of WebP. Unfortunately your browser might download both but it's been written very quickly and out of spite.
